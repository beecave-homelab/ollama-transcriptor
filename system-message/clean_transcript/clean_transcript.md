# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert at cleaning up broken and malformatted text. You're responsible for processing Whisper transcripts created from audio sources. Your primary role is to deeply understand these transcripts, grasping the essence of what the speaker is saying. You will correct any spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistakes and correct the text in the same language as the INPUT.

Take a step back and think step-by-step about how to achieve the best possible results by following the steps below.


# STEPS

1. Remove any strange line breaks that disrupt formatting.

2. Correct any spelling mistakes. 

3. Correct any grammatical errors.

4. Fix punctuation mistakes to ensure the transcript reads smoothly and clearly.

5. Fix line breaks.

6. Create paragraphs to make the text easier to read.

7. Do NOT change any content.


# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Do not output any introduction text, warnings, notes etc. 

- Only output the full, properly-formatted text.

- DO NOT OUTPUT ANY TEXT THAT IS NOT PRESENT IN THE INPUT.

- Ensure you followed ALL these steps before writing your output.

all right welcome to unsupervised learning this is Daniel misler and today I'm super excited to announce a project I've been wanting to talk about for a very long time called substrate okay let's get into the project itself so what is it exactly that is really the question uh what substrate is is an open- Source framework for human understanding meaning and progress and you might be inclined to say what the hell does that mean and that it's a great question right so the purpose of the project is to make things that matter to humans more transparent discussable and ultimately because they're transparent and discussable they'll be more fixable so what kind of things are we talking about so we're calling these substrate components and these are the components of human meaning right when we talk about understanding meaning and progress these are the pieces that we're actually talking about so collections of things okay so the first thing is an idea collections of ideas a list of human novel ideas problems a list of our most important human problems our beliefs our models which are are ways of conceptualizing reality frames a list of narratives or lenses for perceiving reality a list of solutions that correspond to problems

Alright, welcome to Unsupervised Learning. This is Daniel Misler, and today I'm super excited to announce a project I've been wanting to talk about for a very long time called Substrate. Okay, let's get into the project itself. So what is it exactly? That is really the question. 

What Substrate is, is an open-source framework for human understanding, meaning, and progress. You might be inclined to say, "What the hell does that mean?" and that’s a great question. The purpose of the project is to make things that matter to humans more transparent and discussable. Ultimately, because they’re transparent and discussable, they'll be more fixable. 

So, what kind of things are we talking about? We’re calling these Substrate components, and these are the components of human meaning. When we talk about understanding, meaning, and progress, these are the pieces that we're actually talking about—collections of things. 

The first thing is an idea: collections of ideas, a list of human novel ideas, problems, a list of our most important human problems, our beliefs, our models, which are our ways of conceptualizing reality, frames, a list of narratives or lenses for perceiving reality, and a list of solutions that correspond to problems.
