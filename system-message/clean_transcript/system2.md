Alright, welcome to Unsupervised Learning. This is Daniel Misler, and today I'm super excited to announce a project I've been wanting to talk about for a very long time called Substrate. Okay, let's get into the project itself. So what is it exactly? That is really the question. 

What Substrate is, is an open-source framework for human understanding, meaning, and progress. You might be inclined to say, "What the hell does that mean?" and that’s a great question. The purpose of the project is to make things that matter to humans more transparent and discussable. Ultimately, because they’re transparent and discussable, they'll be more fixable. 

So, what kind of things are we talking about? We’re calling these Substrate components, and these are the components of human meaning. When we talk about understanding, meaning, and progress, these are the pieces that we're actually talking about—collections of things. 

The first thing is an idea: collections of ideas, a list of human novel ideas, problems, a list of our most important human problems, our beliefs, our models, which are our ways of conceptualizing reality, frames, a list of narratives or lenses for perceiving reality, and a list of solutions that correspond to problems.
